<h3>About</h3>
<hr>
<p>
  This is a simple application to add a list of goals that have to be achived.
</p>
<p>
  This is what I like to say about the application. <a href="" (click)="sendHome()" ><strong>Take me back</strong></a>
</p>
<h3>Goals</h3>
<ul>
  <li *ngFor="let goal of goals" >
    {{ goal }}
  </li>
</ul>
